        started in 1999 which is like 14 years ago as I think in 2013. I was lucky that
        I had a great college senior Srinivasa Kotu Reddy who helped me buy my first
        computer as I was going after newly lauched Apple laptops at that time. I do not
        even remember its name. He said that it would be better if I buy a normal Intel
        machine. So we purchased and then he installed three operating systems on that.
        As you would expect Windows was there; 98 version of it. Then we had Red Hat 5.1
        and some Solaris. Solaris had some problems with graphics so he quickly removed it.
        Now I was lucky at that time that I had not worked on computers earlier. Because
        of this I had no bias towards GNU/Linux or Windows but I soon started liking
        GNU/Lnux for one reason. The repository gave me one place to hunt for software.
        Whatever, I needed I could find there. For Windows it was a major pain and licenses
        cough cough. I mean if I would have sold myself even then I could not have
        afforded all the software which I wanted to play with. So GNU/Linux it was and
        then I slowly came to know about Debian GNU/Linux for which I used to download
        entire 7 cds for Sarge and 14 for Etch if I remember the names and numbers right.
        Then I moved on to Ubuntu and later Mint for some eye candy and Mate. Also, Debian
        stable does not have latest software all the time.
    </p><p>As time went by I learned my way around with C, C++ using GCC and GDB. I could
        not use Emacs well for a long long time and yet I have to become an Elisp hacker.
        Then I learned Perl, Python and some Ruby etc. In 2011 I started
        <a class="ulink" href="http://libreprogramming.org/" target="_top">http://libreprogramming.org</a>
        to work on free books. I have written almost one complete one on C using C99, then
        started on Data Structures and Algorithms then I though oh you need Math so started
        on Algebra. Then I started working on Kunjika our own Q&A platform for
        libreprogramming. It is reasonably complete but work is still going on. I get bored
        of things quickly so I thought why not write this one in parallel. This idea of this
        book was originally given by one of
        my students as I call my readers, Pavan Mistry. Then my cousin pitched in and he
        too supported the idea. So here I start writing this book. This book will never be
        finished. It will go on and on and on ...

            Now the question is what do you expect to find in this book. Well, I will show
            you how to use GNU/Lunux in particularly I am biased towards deb based Linuses.
            I will show how to use Mint because I like its Mate environment but do not
            worry I will also show how to use KDE, GNOME etc using the same distro. But
            distribution is not even 1% of software which comes with it. I will show best
            of all that and how to use them effectively. For example, using command line,
            VI, Emacs, GCC, GDB, Perl, Python, Valgrind etc for programming. Note that I
            will describe tool aspects not the programming aspects. I will show how to
            configure servers like Apache, Nginx, Postfix, Dovecot, Samba, OpenLDAP.
            I will write also about things like OpenSSL, OpenVPN. If time permits I will add
            rpm based distros also starting with Cent OS and then OpenSUSE. I will show
            how to use CVS, SVN, Git etc and not only using the client side but also how
            to setup servers of these version control softwares. I will try to also show
            you how to use software like ffmpeg, Audacity, Kdenlive, RecordMyDesktop etc
            for video/audio recording and editing. I will also try to tell something about
            Groff, LaTeX, ConTeXt, Docbook like setting up the toolchain. None of this
            stuff is difficult to learn. I will also show sed and awk which are classic
            tools for text manipulation. I will try to teach most common shell commands
            useful in day-to-day work on GNU/Linux. Most of this material is available on
            internet scattered everywhere. It is time to make a garland of these beautiful
            flowers.

            First, I would like to thank my
            parents, wife and son for taking out their fair share of time and the support which they
            have extended to me during my bad times. After that I would like to pay my most sincere
            gratitude to my teachers particularly H. N. Singh, Yogendra Yadav, Satyanand Satyarthi,
            Kumar Shailesh and Prof. T. K. Basu. Now is the turn of people from software community. I
            must thank the entire free software community for all the resources they have developed to
            make computing better. However, few names I know and here they go. Richard Stallman is the
            man behind start of GNU and free software movement. For that matter I should also count the
            contribution of Donald Knuth for contributing TeX long time ago before GNU was started.
            That was the first major contribution to free software commuinity which still exits. I possibly
            cannot write all the names because then possibly an entire chapter will be full of those
            names. :-) I am using Docbook to write this book therefore obviously Normal Walsh deserves
            praise for his work on it. I used Emacs with nxml mode for editing and xsltproc for
            processing docbook. I have my own little python script which makes thing look little
            more beautiful with pygments and twitter bootstrap. It also removed unnecessary  stuff
            from generated html.
        </p><p>I am not a native English speaker and this book has just gone through one pair of eyes
            therefore chances are high that it will have lots of errors. At the same time it may contain
            lots of technical errors. Please feel free to drop me an email at
            <code class="email"><<a class="email" href="mailto:shivshankar.dayal@gmail.com">shivshankar.dayal@gmail.com</a>></code>. I will try to fix all errors and
            incorporate your valuable suggestions. </p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table summary="Navigation footer" width="100%"><tr><td align="left" width="40%"><a accesskey="p" href="../">Prev</a> </td><td align="center" width="20%"> </td><td align="right" width="40%"> <a accesskey="n" href="../introduction/">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" width="40%">A Book on GNU/Linux </td><td align="center" width="20%"><a accesskey="h" href="../">Home</a></td><td align="right" valign="top" width="40%"> Chapter 1.  Introduction </td></tr></table></hr></div><p style="text-align: center;" xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" xmlns:exsl="http://exslt.org/common" xmlns:fo="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Format">© 2013 Shiv S.
