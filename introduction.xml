  <d:title> Introduction </d:title>
  <d:para>
      I do not think I need to introduce GNU/Linux to anyone remotely interested
      in computers and programming in particular. Well, exceptions are always
      there like old people who do nothing but browse, chat and email or
      possibly go to Facebook or kids who have just started working on computers.
      Some people might have heard the term Ubunut or Fedora or OpenSUSE or Mint
      or Debian etc and maybe also using them without knowing that essentially
      all are GNU/Linux variations. You would ask me what is GNU/Linux then
      because all other names mentioned previously are open source operating
      system. You might even ask I have heard of Linux what is this GNU?
      Well, GNU is an acronym which stands for "GNU is not Unix". GNU is an
      ecosystem which provides Linux as its kernel. And no GNU/Linux is not
      only an operating system but it is a complete package. For almost all needs
      you just need to install one of the distributions mentioned. GNU or free
      software movement was started by Richard Stallman in 1983. The objective
      was to provide free operating system. What did you say free means no
      price? No no it means freedom. Free as in freedom not free beer. Remember
      it and never forget because if you forget or do not respect your
      freedom you will end up loosing it. GNU was meant to provide freedom both
      to the programmers and to the users from proprietary software. You do not
      have to spend zillions of dollars to aquire the software and more importantly
      you can modify it because source code is available to you. Now note that
      you can modify it not like other proprietary system where you know there
      is a problem and you know what is the fix but you cannot apply it even
      though you have bought it. Consider you have bought a car and it is
      not working and you know you can fix it then wont you? Will the car company
      come and stop you? No, right. But in software world in the name of
      intellectual property rights money is looted from its users for second grade
      worthless software. You know what I am pointing towards.
